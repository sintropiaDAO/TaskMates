# **Welcome to TaskMates!**

A task-focused regenerative social network where skills meet needs and collaborative connections are facilitated through a personalized task recommendations engine.

TaskMates helps people self-organize around regenerative action and the well-being of the whole. It's part of a behavioral science research project that aims to investigate how information technology can support and scale regenerative behavioral change.
